# Requirements
## Introduction
The Purpose of Cafe Management System is new interface for the cafeterias. This project automate the process of manually maintaining the records related to Cafe Menu and billing System. This project helps the owners of Cafeterias to maintain day to day availability of items in the Shop and generate bill upon users selected items. 

## Research
This is the modified project of my final assessment in Engineering. This project is available in the market with only admin portal. In the current pandemic situation it is not a option for complete lockdown for long days we need to change our habits to be contactless so here i got a thought to have contactless menu for customers visting Cafeterias.

## Cost and Features
1. This is available at the reliable cost in India. 
2. The memory storage is also very less for the System.
3. There are two Portals User Portal and Admin Portal.
4. In Admin Portal, admin can ADD Items,Delete Items, View Menu, View recent Billings, Exit.
5. In User Portal, user can select items using name or using serial number and generate a total bill.

## SWOT ANALYSIS
**Strength:** Maintain the Record of Menu and can view previous bills.
**Weakness:** System does not have customer record and complete payment details.
              User and Admin Portals are accessible to everyone.
**Opportunities:** Modify the items in menu anytime easily.
**Threats:** There is no authentication arranged in the system there are more chance of cyber theft.
